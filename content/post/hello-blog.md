## Brief history of failures

I was tempted to start my blog so many times before. But I had two kind of 
problems which was stopping me:

1. I didn't know what's interesting I can write.
2. It was hard to choose the blogging platform which meets all my needs.

## Why now?

Let's discuss why these problems didn't stop me this time:

#### I hope I'm not so boring anyway ;-)

Recently I've started to think that some of the discussions with my colleagues 
or some of the stories about different open source and work projects can be 
useful and/or interesting to someone else. Also I can get some value myself 
from writing the blog thanks to your future insightful comments and more 
thorough research on posts' topics (because I need to understand something very 
well to explain it to somebody).

#### The first step is the hardest one

I'm a geek and I like simple text tools much more than fancy GUI apps which 
I don't understand and/or control enough to feel myself comfortable.

So I was inclined to the static site generators from the first time I thought 
about blogging. There are another two reasons why I didn't start to use one 
them before:

1. I don't want to deal with the dependency hell of the big projects 
   implemented in interpreted languages, i.e. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
   or [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
2. I'm not very experienced with HTML/CSS/JS so I was afraid that it will be 
   too hard for me to make my blog visually appealing.

I'm a Haskell enthusiast so my favorite option for the very long time was 
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). But it had no themes to choose from so 
I never actually tried to write something real with it.

But lately I've heard about quite popular [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) site 
generator written in Go. I've watched [A New Hugo Site in Under 
2 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Ft2ymGmfc) and I was really 
amazed! It is very straightforward to use and install (just one static binary 
with zero dependencies). And it has more than a 100 
[themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/) to choose from!

## Conclusion

So if you are in a similar position to what I was before I encourage to give 
Hugo a chance!

#### P.S.

I hope to write some stuff soon so stay tuned and thank you for reading!
